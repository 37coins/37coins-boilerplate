RestNucleus-Boilerplate is stack of frameworks to easily create RESTful services on almost any datastore. 

[Restlet](http://www.restlet.org): The leading web API framework for Java
[Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org): High-performance JSON processor
[Datanucleus](http://www.datanucleus.org): This flexibility of API and datastore is not available in any other persistence tool

Introduction:

I found myself using the always same frameworks to create RESTful services for different kind of project and pratforms. I have assembled this stack of frameworks into a stub to be easily extended, tested locally and deployed to Tomcat, AWS Beanstalk, and GAE. Maybe someone might prefer this pure-java aproach to the many opinionated frameworks out there.
